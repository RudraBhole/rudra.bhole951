Website Folder Structure

- The homepage of the website is in the other folder and is called index.html.

- Inside the content folder, there are two main folders: learning and other.

    - learning folder

        - Contains all the learning content pages.

        - Has images and css folders:

        - The css folder includes top.css, middle.css, and bottom.css for the different sections of each learning page.

        - This is why a lot of elements use the class attribute â€” each section has its own stylesheet.

    - other folder

        -Includes tips, extra resources, the playground page, and the homepage.

        - Also has images, music and css folders.

    - Both other and learning pages have:

        - navbar.css -> styles only the navigation bar.

        - footer.css -> styles only the footer.


Note:   The margins are set for large screens (like school computers), not smaller laptop screens, 
        but there are laptop screen margins in the tags if required.
