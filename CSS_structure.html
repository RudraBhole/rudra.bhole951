                CSS structure helps you control how the webpage looks by letting you select HTML elements and apply
                different styles to them. You’ll learn about selectors that target specific parts of the page, and how
                to use properties to change colors, fonts, sizes, spacing, and layout. This gives you the power to make
                your website visually appealing and easy to use, turning plain content into a polished design.

                <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is the language that adds <em>style and personality</em>
                to your website. <br><br><!--the br tag is the next line in the webpage-->
                While <strong>HTML</strong> creates the structure of a page (like headings, paragraphs, and images),
                <strong>CSS</strong> decides how those elements should <em>look</em>.
                <br><!--the br tag is the next line in the webpage-->
                With CSS, you can change <em>colors, fonts, and sizes</em>, add spacing between elements, arrange
                content into columns, and even create <em>animations</em>.
                <br><br><!--the br tag is the next line in the webpage-->

                The word <strong>“cascading”</strong> means that styles follow a set of rules about which ones take
                priority if multiple styles apply to the same element.
                <br><!--the br tag is the next line in the webpage-->
                This gives you <em>flexibility and control</em> in designing your webpage.
                <br><br><!--the br tag is the next line in the webpage-->

                In simple words: <strong>HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the skin and clothing</strong> — it makes your
                website visually appealing, easy to read, and professional.

                <br><!--the br tag is the next line in the webpage-->
                4. End with a semicolon ; <br><br><!--the br tag is the next line in the webpage-->
