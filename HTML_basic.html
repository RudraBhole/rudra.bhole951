                In learning HTML basics, you’ll discover the essential tags that form the foundation of every webpage.
                These tags are like the visible “building blocks” or physical evidence of the site — they tell the
                browser what to show, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other content. Understanding
                these tags helps you structure your page clearly so visitors can easily read and navigate it.
