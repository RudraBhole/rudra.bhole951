                In learning HTML basics, you'll discover the essential tags that form the foundation of every webpage.
                These tags are like the visible “building blocks” or physical evidence of the site — they tell the
                browser what to show, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other content. Understanding
                these tags helps you structure your page clearly so visitors can easily read and navigate it.

                CSS font-size Property<br>
                The font-size property controls how big or small the text appears. You can set it using different units
                such as pixels (px), em (em), or percentages (%).<br>

                Browsers usually use a default font size of 16px for normal text.<br><br>

                So far, all our content has been going right up to the edges of the page. Adding space around content
                makes it easier to read, and more visually appealing<br><br>

                You can add space around content using margins.<br>
                Here, we've add 50 pixels of space on the left of p elements with margin-left.<br><br>

                <span>p {</span><br>
                margin-left: 50px;<br>
                width: 400px;<br>
                <span>}</span><br><br><br><br>
                What if we want to add margins to all sides but don't want to write out all four margin properties?<br>
                We can add margins on all sides at once with the shorthand property margin.<br>
                If you give it just one value, like the example below, it sets all four margins to that value:<br><br>

                <span>&lt;link</span> rel="stylesheet" href="main.css"<span>&gt;</span><br>
                <span>&lt;p&gt;</span>I'm not touching you!<span>&lt;p&gt;</span><br>

                We can use padding to create space around the content inside the border of an element.<br>

                Our content often looks better when it's not squished up against the border.<br>

                You don't need to have a visible border to use padding, but it makes the effect easier to see.<br><br>
